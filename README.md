# Fuzzy-Logic-Based-Tumor-Immune-Escape-Modeling-
The goal of this project is to identify a tumor escape threshold that may be used to forecast the likelihood of immune evasion and enhance cancer treatment approaches. This work offers a more sophisticated method of comprehending immune evasion processes by putting forth a fuzzy logic framework for modeling VISTA-mediated tumor escape.
